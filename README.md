# **Holocub V2 – 16×16×16 RGB LED Cube**

![LED Cube Example](docs/Videos/Prototype.mp4)  
*A fully addressable 3D LED display for animations, games, and visual effects.*

---

## 📜 Overview
Holocub V2 is a large-scale **16×16×16 RGB LED cube** (4096 voxels total) built with WS2812B addressable LEDs.  
It is designed to display dynamic animations, interactive effects, and data visualizations in 3D.

The cube is controlled by a microcontroller (planned: **RPi Pico 2W / other capable MCU**) and supports both **procedural animations** and **pre-rendered frames** loaded from an SD card.

# HoloBoard – PCB by Dragoș

**Short description**  
HoloBoard is a custom PCB designed for the Holocub project, acting as the main control and interface board.  
It hosts a Raspberry Pi Pico 2W, integrates a piezo buzzer, and features two bidirectional logic-level shifters for for the communication between the pico and the WS2812B as 3v3 logic could cause interference.

## 🔧 Key Features
- **MCU Slot:** Raspberry Pi Pico 2W header footprint (solder-in or socket).
- **Audio Output:** 1 × piezo buzzer connector (with optional series resistor).
- **Expandable hardware:** Left over pins (used mainly for I²C and SPI) routed to the side for extra connectivity.
- **Build Quality:** Silk labels for pins, test pads, and mounting holes.
- **Filter capacitors:** 2 filter caps for main power connection and 1 for each logic level shofter for optimal data transmission without interference.

## 📦 Minimal BOM
- 1 × RP2040 (Pico 2W) socket / header footprint
- Headers, pads, mounting hardware
- Yet to add more info

## 🚀 Features
- **Scalable architecture** – animations work on both 4×4×4 test cube and full 16×16×16 cube. 
- **Voxel-based rendering** – uses a global `voxelMatrix[x][y][z]` buffer for color control.
- **Procedural animations** – gradients, bouncing “DVD logo” effect, rain simulation, waves.
- **Pre-rendered playback** – read `.vox` file for animations or custom binary format.
- **Custom GFX library** – draw lines, planes, waves, text in 3D space.
- **SD card support** – load animations without reflashing firmware.
- **Multi-PSU design** – independent PSU per cube tower for stable power delivery.
- **Website based animation upload and debug** - Upload animations or images directly from a computer to the Holocube.

---

## ⚡ Power & Safety Notes
- WS2812B LEDs consume up to **60 mA per LED** at full brightness (white).
- Theoretical maximum current: **~245 A total** across 4 PSUs.
- Always fuse PSU outputs and use thick wiring for high-current paths.
- Avoid running full white at 100% brightness for prolonged periods to reduce heat.

---

## 🖥️ Software Workflow
### **Procedural animations**
- Written in C++ inside `/animations`
- Rendered directly to `voxelMatrix`
- Useful for dynamic effects and parameterized visuals

### **Pre-rendered animations**
- Created in Paint, MagicaVoxel, or similar tools
- Exported as `.bmp` or custom `.hca` (Holocub Animation) binary format
- Loaded via SD card at runtime
